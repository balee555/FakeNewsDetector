## Welcome to the FakeNews Detector App

In today's political climate, biased and untrustworthy news articles are everywhere. One news site may claim the Democrats are trying to monitor the enitre American populace with Big Government, while another says that the Republicans are busy trying to deport everyone who doesn't agree with their tax agenda. 

While it is obvious to most people that neither of these two examples are true, it becomes more difficult to distinguish the role of bias in more subtle articles. Most people don't have the time, or sometimes the training to sift through dense political articles to determine what is actually true and what is a product of a manipulative news site. Our app simplifies this problem by doing the work for you. 

## How it Works

### Step 1:
First, we extract named entities. By this we mean the names of organizations and polititians. Take for example the headline of the Atlantic article:

Will Donald Trump Destroy the Presidency?
He disdains the rule of law. He’s trampling norms of presidential behavior. And he’s bringing vital institutions down with him.

In this sentence we would extract
