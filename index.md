## Welcome to the FakeNews Detector App

In today's political climate, biased and untrustworthy news articles are everywhere. One news site may claim the Democrats are trying to monitor the enitre American populace with Big Government, while another says that the Republicans are busy trying to deport everyone who doesn't agree with their tax agenda. 

While it is obvious to most people that neither of these two examples are true, it becomes more difficult to distinguish where bias plays a role in more subtle articles.
